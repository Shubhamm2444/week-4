Here's how to add the Express.js framework to your Node.js project:

1. Project Setup (if you don't have an existing project):
Create a new directory for your project using your terminal.
Navigate to the project directory using cd.
Initialize a new project with npm init -y to create a package.json file. This file will manage your project's dependencies.

2. Install Express.js:
In your terminal, run the following command to install Express.js:
Bash
npm install express

This command downloads the Express.js package from the npm registry and adds it as a dependency to your project's package.json file.

3. Import Express in Your JavaScript File:
Create a JavaScript file (e.g., server.js) where you'll be using Express.js.
At the top of your server.js file, import Express using the require statement:
JavaScript
const express = require('express');

This line tells your code to import the Express.js module and assigns it to the express constant.

4. Create an Express Application:
Now that you have imported Express, you can create an Express application instance:
JavaScript
const app = express();

The app object will be used to define routes, middleware, and handle requests in your Node.js server.

Congratulations! You've successfully added the Express.js framework to your Node.js project. Now you can use Express features like defining routes, handling requests, and sending responses to build your web application or API.
