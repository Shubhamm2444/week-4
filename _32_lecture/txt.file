Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js
Here's a guided approach to creating a RESTful API in Node.js using the popular Express.js framework:

1. Project Setup:
Create a project directory: Use your terminal to create a new directory for your project.
Initialize npm: Navigate to the project directory and run npm init -y to create a package.json file.

2. Install Express.js:
In your terminal, run npm install express to install the Express.js framework.

3. Create a Server File:
Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., server.js) in your project directory.

4. Include Express and Create an App:
Import Express at the top of your server.js file:
JavaScript
const express = require('express');
Use code with caution.

Create an Express application instance:
JavaScript
const app = express();

5. Define Routes:
Routes map incoming HTTP requests to specific handler functions in your app.
Use Express methods like get, post, put, and delete to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) corresponding to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Example Route (GET request to retrieve all users):

JavaScript
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to fetch all users from a database (replace with your implementation)
  const users = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob' },
  ];
  res.json(users); // Send the users data as JSON in the response
});

6. Handle Requests and Send Responses:
Inside the route handler functions, write logic to handle the request, process data (e.g., interact with a database), and send a response back to the client.
Use the res object to send responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found) and data (often in JSON format).

7. Start the Server:
Use the app.listen method to start the server and listen for incoming requests on a specific port:
JavaScript
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});

8. Running the API:
In your terminal, run node server.js to start the server.
Use tools like Postman or curl to send HTTP requests to your API endpoints and see the responses.

9:Example using Postman:
Open Postman and create a GET request for http://localhost:3000/users.
Send the request. Postman should display the JSON response containing the list of users.

#: Remember:
Implement error handling for unexpected situations.
Use middleware for common tasks like parsing request bodies or logging requests.
Secure your API with authentication and authorization mechanisms for production use.
