1: Mongoose Schemas:
A Mongoose schema defines the structure of your documents (data) within a MongoDB collection.
It acts like a blueprint, specifying the fields (properties) a document can have and their data types.
Schemas provide several benefits:
Data Validation: Ensure data conforms to the expected format (e.g., required fields, data type checks).
Code Maintainability: Improve code readability and consistency when working with your data.
Type Safety: Catch potential errors during development by defining expected data types.

Remember:
Replace placeholders like 'user_id' with actual IDs retrieved from your application.
Error handling (.catch) is crucial for robust development.

Additional Considerations:
Mongoose offers advanced features like relationships between models (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) and middleware functions for data manipulation before saving or retrieval.
